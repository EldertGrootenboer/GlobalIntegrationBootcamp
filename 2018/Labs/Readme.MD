This is where you will find the labs for our second Global Integration Bootcamp event.

We as global organizers have created several labs ourselves, and you can of course also have a look at last years labs. In addition to this, we also have selected several other labs and tutorials created by Microsoft and the community, which we think will be interesting for you as well. All credits go to the original creators.
