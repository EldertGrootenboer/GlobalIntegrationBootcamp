# Global Integration Bootcamp
The Global Integration Bootcamp is a free event, driven by user groups and communities around the world, backed by Microsoft, for anyone who wants to learn more about Microsoft’s integration story. In this full-day boot camp we will deep-dive into Microsoft’s integration stack with hands-on sessions and labs, delivered to you by the experts and community leaders.

This repository will contain all the presentations and labs which are created by the great community participating in this event. Feel free to add your own content which you would like to share.
